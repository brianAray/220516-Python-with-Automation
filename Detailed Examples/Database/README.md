# Introduction
These examples explain the configuration and usage of our Pythons connection to a database. The specific database doesn't matter too much, for these examples it will be PostgreSQL but if you use a different variation on SQL no matter. You will have to change a few places but it will be obvious more or less and if it's not, the program will let you know!
