# Interview Practice Guide

## Interview Tips

Before diving into the code right away, you interviewer will probably make some small talk, but really they are looking into your background:

- **Confidence** : Do you think you know how to code?
- **Leadership** : Do you finish your code, reach out to others, take charge, etc.
- **Communication** : Is it actually useful to talk through a problem with you?

Things to be aware of before the interview:

- A technical problem you solved
- An example of when you showed leadership
- How you implemented Agile teamwork
- How you have learned coding and improved
- Your thoughts on your batchmates (be positive!)
- What you love about coding (Showing passion is key)

Once you have went through the chit chat (practice with your team, get comfortable talking about yourself). You will normally go into the technical part of the interview. The interviewer is looking for a team member, so make sure you present yourself as a good team member and walk through the code as communicative as possible. For example:

- **Think out loud**
  - Don't be silent, even if you don't know what you are doing, explain your thoughts
  - Being quiet goes against what is a good team player, if your code works it is not what they really want
- **Say you don't know**
  - If you're not sure, ask them, and if you still don't know then just say you need more of an explanation
  - They won't bite your head off, if you don't know then don't just make stuff up
  - Maybe you are not comfortable with that language so explain what you do know with what you are comfortable with
- **Slow down**
  - This isn't a race, you have time
  - Breathe
  - The faster you go, the more likely you are to make a simple mistake
  - Explain what you are doing with each line you write, this will force you to slow down if you find yourself racing through the code
  - When you answer a question, don't just say the right answer, explain it and give examples
  - Remember, you want to be a good team member and being able to explain a technical problem is essential

# Essentials

> Here are some of the things you need to be comfortable with to breeze through your interviews. Things may be outside of what you have learnt during your training, and that's fine, coding interviews are a challenge.

## Algorithms

Algorithms are a big part of programming and a staple of coding interviews. Learn these topics and practice implementing different algorithms in the languages you were trained in.

### Big O Notations
How to compare the efficiency of different solutions to a problem, like sorting or searching algorithms. It is difficult to verbalize how much better an algorithm can be when comparing them with each other so Big O Notation is a classic solution to it.

### Data Structures
Know how to make different data structures or how they are implemented in a fundamental level, maybe not the exact code for the language. What is an Array, how is it created, why is it used, etc. 
> A common question with Java is how an Array List is made and why would you use it over a linked list, or vice versa

### Logarithms

Logarithms is a big part of algorithms so understanding at least what they even are and what they are trying to show is needed to describe algorithms and how they work.

# Potential Coding Interview Questions

Coding is not uncommon and some interviews may have you do 4 - 5 questions. Don't learn all of them, but know a few of the back of your hand and be able to explain it. You will be surprised how often they repeat
