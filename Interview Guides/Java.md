# Java

The interviewers can ask you many different types of questions on a wide range of subjects. To give you a better idea of what they could ask, here are a few potential ones that have come up either before or a calculated guess. It is important to have a balance between practical and technical knowledge on the technologies you learn. However, even with both aspects of understanding, one of the most critical skills is being able to convey it in an interview setting.

The only way to get better at interviews is to practice. Setup practice interviews with each other and get comfortable talking about programming and your project. You will be asked about what you did during your training so be ready to explain what you have done.
