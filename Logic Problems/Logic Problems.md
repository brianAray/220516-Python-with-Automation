# Logic Problems

Here are some logic problems that need to be solved. The solution has to be wrote in a step by step manner, as if you were telling it to a child. This means clear instructions and no ambiguity.

If you are confident in programming, try writing the solutions with pseudo-code.

## Easy

### 1. Summer Camp

Abigail, Oliver, Rosa, and Blake all attend the same summer camp, where they can cook, kayak, rock climb, and zip-line. Each child has a different favorite activity.

- Abigail’s favorite activity isn’t rock climbing.
- Oliver is afraid of heights.
- Rosa can’t do her favorite activity without a harness.
- Blake likes to keep his feet on the ground at all times.

Can you figure out who likes what?

### 2. The Good Life

Each of five neighborhood dogs (Saber, Ginger, Nutmeg, Pepper, and Bear) is enjoying one of the following activities: getting its ears scratched, playing catch, taking a nap, burying a chew toy, and going for a walk.

- Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy.
- Neither Ginger nor Saber nor Bear is on a walk.
- One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched.
- A dog not named for a spice is playing catch.
- Bear is getting some exercise.

Can you figure out what each dog is doing?

### 3. The Long and the Short of It

Six neighborhood children (Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.

- Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
- Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
- Benito is not the shortest.

Can you put them in order of height from tallest to shortest?

### 1. Dads and Grads

A joint Father’s Day and graduation party is being thrown for Michael, Ken, James, Alberto, Elias, and Stephanie. Three of them are newly minted high school graduates. The other three are their dads.

- Stephanie went to the senior prom with Michael’s son.
- Elias and James played on the school’s baseball team. One of them is Alberto’s son.
- Michael and Elias are not related.

Can you match the high school graduates to their fathers at this joint celebration?

### 2. Party at Charlie's

And this one is a good logic puzzle for adults. You’ve been invited to a party at Charlie’s house, but you’ve never been there. He has seven friends who live nearby. They’ve given you a map showing all of their houses and Charlie’s house, along with the following information:

- Daniel: I can’t see Benita’s house, because Greta’s house is in the way.
- Adam: I live directly (not diagonally) across the street from Daniel.
- Benita: Elena lives due west of me.
- Elena: I have to cross three streets to walk to Franco’s house.
- Hal: I live east of Benita.

Can you figure out which house is Charlie’s?

These are optional, but for each one solved you'll receive points for your team.

### 1. Pass the Salt, Please

```
        🧂                  🧂                  🧂                          🧂
A. This is salt     B. This is salt     C. This is sugar        D. The salt in not in B
```

It's April fool's day and your roommate has replaced the salt in three of your four salt shakers with sugar and left a message on each.
If only one of these inscriptions is true, which shaker still contains salt?

### 2. New Parents

Ruby and Lewis are expecting…triplets! They already know what they will name their three children, but they aren’t sharing the names until the babies are born. For now, this is all they’ll say:

- All three babies are boys.
- Their names are six letters long and anagrams of one another.
- Their names include both of their parents’ initials, but none of the other letters in their parents’ first names.

What will Ruby and Lewis name their triplets?
