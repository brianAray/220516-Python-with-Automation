# Week 1 - Day 2 - Python / Flask
A study guide to help you know what to research and where to find information for the topics this week. This should not be treated as your only source of information but as a jump off point to create your own research documents. Collaborate with your team and your batch mates to get a wide range of topics covered quickly. The training course is fast so make sure you take your time to understand the underlying knowledge with the technologies you will see during training.

# Useful Tools

### [Data Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvQ7e6yUtnw)
Creating classes and objects is a key part of working the an object oriented language. However, once you start using it more and more you may want to explore options that Python provides to make your life a little easier. Dataclasses help simplify the process and is part of the standard library, but it is not required to be used. Classes and Objects however are required so don't use this as a crutch!

> This guide shows extra features for Python 3.10, we are currently working with Python 3.9 so be careful with including it if your version is not compatible!
