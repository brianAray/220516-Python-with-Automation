# Week 1 - Day 3 - Python / Flask
A study guide to help you know what to research and where to find information for the topics this week. This should not be treated as your only source of information but as a jump off point to create your own research documents. Collaborate with your team and your batch mates to get a wide range of topics covered quickly. The training course is fast so make sure you take your time to understand the underlying knowledge with the technologies you will see during training.

# Useful Tools

### [Why shouldn't `except:...`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrVfY9SuO64)

More information on `try...except` that will be useful to understand why we use it and what you shouldn't do with it.


### [List Comprehensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=belS2Ek4-ow)

List comprehensions aren't needed in your training, however, it is one of the most useful parts of working with Python and can save you a lot of time. It can be confusing to use initially, but if you are interested there are plenty of resources on it!
