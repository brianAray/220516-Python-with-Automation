# Week 6 - Day 1 - Automation Testing
A study guide to help you know what to research and where to find information for the topics this week. This should not be treated as your only source of information but as a jump off point to create your own research documents. Collaborate with your team and your batch mates to get a wide range of topics covered quickly. The training course is fast so make sure you take your time to understand the underlying knowledge with the technologies you will see during training.
