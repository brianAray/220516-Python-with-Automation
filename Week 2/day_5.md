# Useful Tools

### [Hashing Passwords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvstbO787Qo)

If you are storing credentials and want to be safe to potential leaks in your database then hashing them is essential. Effectively encrypting it so if somehow your database leaks and a users password is shown to the world, it will be nonsense to anyone looking at it as it has been hashed. This is not needed for your project but it is a useful tool to know how to use for actual development.
